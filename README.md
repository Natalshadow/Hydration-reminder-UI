Project Overview Hydrobot is a cross-platform desktop application built in Go using the Fyne toolkit. It provides a non-intrusive UI for health-related reminders, pulling randomized strings from a decoupled TOML configuration file.

Development Process: Conceptual AI Tutoring
This project was developed using a strict 'No-Code AI Tutoring' methodology/Socratic methodology. While LLMs were used as a resource, the AI was restricted to providing textual explanations and conceptual guidance only.

The Workflow:
I defined the architectural requirements, the AI provided conceptual explanations (e.g., explaining the theory of Mutexes and Goroutines).
I manually translated those concepts into Go code, debugging and implementing the logic without any direct code generation or 'copy-pasting'. Relying instead on Go documentation and traditional learning resources.
